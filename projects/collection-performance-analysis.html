          Analysis Pipeline
        </h3>

        <ul class="blog">
          <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong><br> Used Excel and R for data cleaning. In the transaction Table, all Transaction dates for interest payments were recorded as text/characters. Importing such data to Power BI would show an error. Decided to use R with the use of the Lubridate library to convert the column to a datatype that will allow any date functions to be carried out.</li>

          <li><strong>Data Joining:</strong><br> Then joined the transaction table in Excel,</li>

          <li><strong>Data Presentation:</strong><br> Changed columns to appropriate data types that fit the aim of the analysis and performed neccessary manipulation.Carried out data visualization using Power BI to create a Collection Performance Dashboard.</li>
        </ul>
