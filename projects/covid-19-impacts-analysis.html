        <h3>
          Conclusion
        </h3>

        <p>
          The Covid-19 pandemic has affected almost all countries in the world, with varying degrees of severity. The total number of cases and deaths are correlated, suggesting that countries with higher cases are likely to have higher deaths as well. The stringency index of a country, which measures the strictness of Covid-19 control measures, is negatively correlated with the number of cases and deaths, suggesting that stricter measures have been effective in reducing the spread of the virus.The outbreak of covid-19 resulted in the highest number of covid-19 cases and deaths in the united states. One major reason behind this is the stringency index of the United States. It is comparatively low according to the population. All the countries GDP per capital were affected during the outbreak of covid-19.

        <h3>
          Recommendations
        </h3>
        
        <ul class="blog">
          <li>
            Governments and health authorities should continue to prioritize the implementation of effective Covid-19 control measures, such as increased testing, contact tracing, and vaccination campaigns, in order to reduce the number of cases and deaths.
          </li>
          <li>
            Countries with lower levels of development and income should be supported with additional resources and funding to improve their capacity to manage the pandemic and limit its impacts on their populations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Further research should be conducted to explore the specific factors that contribute to the varying impacts of Covid-19 on different countries, in order to inform more targeted interventions and policies.
          </li>
