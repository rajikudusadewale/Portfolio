          </li><br>
          <li>
            <strong>Develop SQL Query</strong><br>
            Used Union SQL query to develop the data 2018, 2019, and 2020 into a unified single table. After the data merging, got a total of 100,756 rows with 32 columns. Used SQL Queries to answer this question; Is the hotel revenue growing? To answer the bsuiness question using SQL query, needed to create a revenue column.

        <h3>
          ANSWERS TO THE BUSINESS QUESTIONS;
        </h3>

        <ol class="blog">
          <li>
            <strong>Is the hotel revenue growing by year?</strong><br>
            The hotel's revenues are increasing by year, and this is true for both City Hotel and Resort Hotel. From 2018to 2019, there was a significant increase in revenue for both hotels, with a slight decrease in 2020, most likely due to the pandemic. The line chart shows a steady increase in revenue for both hotels over the years.
          </li><br>

          <li>
            <strong>Should the stakeholders increase the parking lot size?</strong><br>
            The data shows a slight increase in the required car parking space over the years, indicating that guests with personal cars are increasing. However, it is important to note that there is no correlation between parking space and revenue. Therefore, increasing the parking lot size might not necessarily lead to an increase in revenue. It would be wise to conduct further analysis to determine the impact of increasing parking space on revenue.
          </li><br>

          <li>
            <strong>What trends can we see in the data?</strong><br>
            The average daily rate (ADR) seems to fluctuate throughout the years, with the highest ADR recorded in 2020. However, this might be due to the pandemic, which might have led to fewer guests and an increase in the ADR. There is also a noticeable seasonality trend in the data, with a higher ADR during the summer months and a lower ADR during the winter months. Total nights booked also follow a similar trend, with more bookings during the summer months.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
          Based on the above analysis, it is recommended that the hotel management team take the following steps:
        </h3>

        <ul class="blog">
          <li>
            Continue to focus on increasing revenue for both hotels by implementing targeted marketing campaigns and offering discounts during low season months.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conduct further analysis to determine the impact of increasing parking space on revenue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider adjusting pricing strategies during peak and off-peak seasons to optimize revenue and occupancy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overall, with the growing trend in hotel revenue and the potential for increased revenue through targeted marketing campaigns and adjusting pricing strategies, the hotel management team should focus on these areas to drive future growth.
          </li>
